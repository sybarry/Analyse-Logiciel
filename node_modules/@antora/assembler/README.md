# Antora Assembler

A library for writing Antora extensions that combine multiple pages into one.

Assembler works by constructing aggregate AsciiDoc documents from the pages based on the navigation tree per component version.
It then invokes the specified callback to convert those documents to an output format.
If a catalog is specified, Assembler pushes the converted files back into the catalog to be published as attachments alongside the other files in the site.

[Antora](https://antora.org) is a modular static site generator designed for creating documentation sites from AsciiDoc documents.
The Assembler extends the feature set of Antora by providing the foundation for page aggregation.
